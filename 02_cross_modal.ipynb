    "The [Audio-to-Image Search Plugin](https://github.com/jacobmarks/audio-retrieval-plugin) is a FiftyOne plugin that allows searching for images similar to a given audio clip. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the `ImageBind` embedding model to embed images and audio clips into a shared 1024-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storing the embeddings in a `Qdrant` similarity index for fast similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providing a FiftyOne UI for uploading audio clips, pre-filtering, and searching the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plugin supports `ogg` and `wav` audio files, but not `mp3`. It makes an API call to Replicate to avoid potential installation issues with running the embedding model locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ImageBind learns a joint embedding space across multiple modalities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageBind exploits the natural co-occurrence of images with other modalities to learn a unified representation that binds them together without requiring exhaustive paired data. It uses the frozen CLIP image-text embedding space as the target for alignment. This simple yet powerful approach enables novel multimodal capabilities to emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ImageBind learns a single embedding space that binds together six modalities: images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. This allows it to align and connect information from these various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importantly, ImageBind does not require all combinations of paired data to train this joint embedding. It leverages the fact that images naturally co-occur with the other modalities. By training on image-paired it can implicitly align all the modalities together using the images as an anchor or \"binding\" modality.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Each modality has its own encoder, e.g., a ViT for images, audio spectrograms, depth maps, etc., and a transformer for IMU sequences. A modality-specific linear projection head is added to each encoder to obtain a fixed-dimensional embedding. This embedding is normalized and used in the contrastive InfoNCE loss during training. `This is important, so let me break it down:`\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Separate encoders for each modality**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ImageBind uses different encoder architectures tailored to each modality. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - For images, audio spectrograms, and depth maps, they employ Vision Transformers (ViT) as the encoder backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sequences, which consist of accelerometer and gyroscope readings over time, they use a standard Transformer encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Modality-specific linear projection heads:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The raw output from each modality's encoder may have different dimensionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To align them into a common embedding space, ImageBind adds a linear projection head on top of each encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This projection head is just a simple fully-connected layer that maps the encoder output to a fixed target dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The weights of these projection heads are learned during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Embedding normalization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After the linear projection, the embeddings from each modality are normalized. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Normalization here likely refers to L2 normalization, where the embedding vectors are scaled to have unit length.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Normalization makes the embeddings more comparable and is a common practice in contrastive learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **InfoNCE contrastive loss:**\n",
    "    - The normalized embeddings from all modalities are used to compute the InfoNCE contrastive loss during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - InfoNCE is a popular choice for self-supervised contrastive learning. It encourages embeddings of positive pairs (e.g. an image and its caption) to be close, while pushing apart embeddings of negative pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By using InfoNCE across embeddings from different modalities, ImageBind learns to align them into a shared semantic space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The image and text encoders are initialized from a pretrained CLIP model and frozen during training. The other modality encoders are learned to align with this frozen CLIP image-text embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Through this training on image-paired data, ImageBind implicitly learns to align non-paired modalities, like text and audio. For example, training on (image, text) and (image, audio) pairs enables ImageBind to connect text and audio without seeing them paired."
