    "# Concept Space Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept space traversal refers to navigating and exploring the high-dimensional vector space in which data points (such as words, images, or other entities) are embedded based on their semantic relationships or similarities. You can use this for exploring and manipulating the semantic relationships captured by embeddings, enabling applications like concept generation, similarity search, and analogy discovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a way to navigate the abstract space of concepts and ideas represented in high-dimensional vector spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about concept space traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding space:** Data points are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similar concepts are positioned close to each other based on their semantic relationships. This space is often referred to as the embedding space or concept space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Similarity measures:** The proximity or similarity between data points in the embedding space is typically measured using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Points that are closer together are considered more semantically similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traversal methods:** Concept space traversal involves moving from one point to another within the embedding space. This can be done through various methods, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Linear interpolation: Creating intermediate points between two concepts by taking weighted averages of their vector representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Vector arithmetic: Performing operations like addition or subtraction on concept vectors to find analogies or explore relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Nearest neighbour search: Finding the closest points to a given concept vector to discover related concepts.\n"

    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You select a starting image from their dataset, then iteratively add text concepts with relative strengths to move around the multimodal embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behind the scenes, it generates embedding vectors for the text prompts, combines them with the starting image vector, and performs a similarity search on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating the plugin required generating a multimodal similarity index (e.g. using a CLIP model) on the dataset first.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the plugin, a similarity index that supports prompts (i.e., embeds both text and images) must be present on the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be created using the `fiftyone.brain` module, specifically the `compute_similarity` function, which takes the dataset, a `brain_key`, the `model_name` (e.g., \"clip-vit-base32-torch\"), and the `metric` (e.g., \"cosine\") as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plugin can be installed by running the command `fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/jacobmarks/concept-interpolation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plugin provides two main operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `open_interpolation_panel`: Opens the interpolation panel when clicked, but is only activated when the dataset has a similarity index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `interpolator`: Runs the actual interpolation between the two text prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this FiftyOne plugin enables users to explore the latent space between two text concepts by interpolating between their embeddings and visualizing the results, providing an interactive way to understand the relationships between different text prompts.\n"
